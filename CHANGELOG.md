- **Queue Item Updates**: Status/progress updates now skip no-op changes and update by index for fewer allocations
- **Directory Creation**: Download output folders are created once per path, reducing repeated I/O for albums/singles
- **Search Results Rendering**: Single-pass filtering avoids repeated `indexOf` calls for large result sets
- **Queue Lookups in UI**: O(1) lookup for queue status in Home/Album/Playlist/Artist track lists
- **History Filtering**: Album/single counts and grouping are computed once per build
- **Downloaded Album View**: Tracks are grouped by disc in one pass to reduce filtering overhead
- **Track Metadata Screen**:

  - Use `indexWhere` instead of `firstWhere` with placeholder object to reduce allocations in queue processing
- **Flutter UI Optimizations**:
  - Selective `ref.watch()` for `downloadQueueProvider` (watch only `queuedCount` or `items` instead of entire state)
  - Pass `Track` directly to `_buildTrackTile()` instead of index lookup inside builder
  - Pass `historyItems` as parameter to `_buildRecentAccess()` to avoid `ref.read()` inside method
- **M4A Metadata Embedding**: Streaming implementation reduces memory usage for large files
  - Uses `os.Open()` + `ReadAt` instead of `os.ReadFile()` (no full file load into memory)
  - Atomic file replacement via temp file + rename for safer writes
  - New helper functions: `findAtomInRange()`, `readAtomHeaderAt()`, `copyRange()`

### Backend

- **Deezer ISRC Fetching**: Uses ISRCs already present in payloads and caches them, cutting extra API calls
- **SearchAll Allocation**: Preallocated slices to reduce allocations during Deezer search
- **HTTP Client Helper**: Refactored HTTP client creation to use `NewHTTPClientWithTimeout()` helper function across `lyrics.go`, `qobuz.go`, `tidal.go`

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed

- **ISRC Metadata Missing:** Fixed an issue where ISRC codes were not being saved to the download history or embedded in file metadata for certain downloads. The backend now correctly propagates the ISRC found from streaming services (Tidal, Qobuz, Amazon) back to the application.
- **Tidal Track/Disc Numbers:** Fixed missing Track Number and Disc Number in Tidal downloads. The downloader now prioritizes the actual metadata returned by Tidal over the potentially incomplete metadata from the initial search request.
- **Concurrent Download Race Condition:** Fixed a potential race condition where temporary cover art files could overwrite each other during rapid concurrent downloads by adding randomization to temporary filenames.
- **Qobuz Search Accuracy:** Reduced the duration tolerance for Qobuz search matches from 30s to 10s to prevent matching with incorrect versions/remixes.
- **Metadata Enrichment Null Safety**: Fixed `type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'String'` error

### Added

- **ISRC in History:** The Download History now reliably displays the ISRC code for downloaded tracks.
- **Tidal Search Optimization:** Optimized Tidal search logic to immediately check for ISRC matches within search results, improving match speed and accuracy.
  - Returns as soon as ISRC match is found in first query results
  - Significantly faster for tracks with valid ISRC
- **ISRC Enrichment for Search Results**: Tracks from Home search now fetch ISRC before download
  - Search results don't include ISRC (for performance)
  - ISRC is now fetched via metadata enrichment when download starts
  - Ensures accurate track matching on all streaming services
- **Deezer-to-Tidal Fallback:** Added native support for converting Deezer IDs to Tidal links via SongLink when using the fallback mechanism.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- **Parallel Downloads**: Download up to 3 tracks simultaneously (configurable in Settings)
  - Default: Sequential (1 at a time) for stability
  - Options: 1, 2, or 3 concurrent downloads
  - Warning about potential rate limiting from streaming services
- **Download Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress for BTS manifest downloads from Tidal
- **History Persistence**: Download history now persists across app restarts using SharedPreferences
- **Connection Pooling**: Shared HTTP transport to prevent TCP connection exhaustion during large batch downloads
- **Connection Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of idle connections every 50 downloads and at queue end

### Fixed

- **Download Progress Bug**: Fixed 0% → 100% jump by adding proper progress tracking for BTS format downloads
- **TCP Connection Exhaustion**: Fixed slow downloads after ~300 tracks by implementing connection pooling and periodic cleanup
- **Trailing Space in Names**: Fixed download failures when playlist/album/track names have trailing spaces
- **History Loss on Debug**: History no longer disappears when sideloading via `flutter run --debug`

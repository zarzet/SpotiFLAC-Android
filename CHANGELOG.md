# Changelog

## [3.5.3] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- CSV import flow now includes a new option: **Skip already downloaded songs** before enqueueing tracks
- Added regression test suite for cross-script matching behavior in Go backend (`go_backend/matching_test.go`)

### Changed

- CSV import confirmation dialog now supports filtering out tracks already present in download history (matched by Spotify ID and ISRC)
- CSV import enqueue feedback now reports added/skipped counts when duplicate downloads are skipped
- Home search now prioritizes **Recent Access** when search field is focused with empty input, even if old search results still exist in memory
- Search filter/result sections are now hidden while Recent Access mode is active to avoid stale-result overlap
- Recent Access now shows a localized empty-state message when no recent items are available
- Normalized collapsing AppBar top inset across iOS/Android so header height/animation stays visually consistent on Apple devices
- Storage & Cache UX improved: `Clear all cache` now preserves web/runtime cache by default (optional), with explicit warnings/actions for runtime cache resets
- Local library settings now include a display count for tracks excluded because they already exist in download history
- Responsive layout tuning applied across key screens to reduce hardcoded-height overflow issues on smaller devices

### Fixed

- Fixed false-positive cross-script matching in Qobuz/Tidal where unrelated titles/artists in different scripts could be incorrectly accepted
- Cross-script title/artist matching now requires transliteration-aware normalization and strict similarity checks instead of auto-accepting script differences
- Qobuz metadata fallback no longer scans all results when zero title matches are found; title verification is now required
- Qobuz metadata final validation now rejects results when title does not match expected track name
- Fixed Home search regression where Recent Access panel could disappear after previous searches
- Fixed Local Library card/layout crash caused by `Flex` usage under unbounded height constraints
- Hardened FFmpeg metadata embedding temp-file naming to prevent rare collisions during parallel downloads/fallback flows (Qobuz → Tidal) that could cause missing embedded metadata
- Fixed SAF external lyrics naming where some providers saved `.lrc` files as `.lrc.txt`; LRC export now uses neutral MIME to preserve `.lrc` extension

## [3.5.2] - 2026-02-08

### Performance

- Home tab search result sections are now virtualized with `SliverList` (lazy item build) instead of eager `Column` rendering, reducing frame drops on large result sets
- Home tab now narrows Riverpod subscriptions using field-level `select(...)` for search/provider state to reduce unnecessary full-tab rebuilds
- Search provider dropdown now watches only required fields (`searchProvider`, `metadataSource`, `extensions`) instead of full provider states
- Track row rendering in Home search now receives precomputed thumbnail sizing/local-library flags from parent to avoid repeated per-item provider watches
- Removed thumbnail `debugPrint` calls inside track row `build()` to reduce runtime overhead during scrolling/rebuilds
- Queue tab root subscription no longer watches full queue item list; it now watches only queue presence (`items.isNotEmpty`) to avoid full Library UI rebuilds on every progress tick
- Queue download header/list rendering has been isolated into dedicated `Consumer` slivers; header now watches only queue length (`items.length`) while item list watches queue item updates
- Queue filter/sort computations are now centralized and memoized per filter mode within a build pass (`all`/`albums`/`singles`), reducing repeated list transforms for chip counts and page content
- Selection bottom bar content is now computed only when selection mode is active, removing hidden-state heavy list preparation
- File existence checks in queue/library rows now use per-path `ValueNotifier` + `ValueListenableBuilder` updates instead of triggering global `setState`, reducing unnecessary whole-tab repaints

### Changed

- Replaced date range filter with sorting options in Library tab: Latest, Oldest, A-Z, Z-A
- Sorting applies to all views: unified items, downloaded albums, and local library albums
- Local library items now use file modification time (`fileModTime`) for sorting instead of scan time, providing more accurate chronological ordering
- Removed redundant manual "Export Failed Downloads" button from Library UI (auto-export setting in Settings is sufficient)
- Library filters (quality, format, source) now correctly apply to album tabs and update tab chip counts (All/Albums/Singles)

### Fixed

- Fixed local library scan crashing on Samsung One UI devices due to MediaStore URI mismatch in SAF tree traversal
- Added MediaStore URI fallback in SAF file reader: when SAF permission is denied for Samsung-returned MediaStore URIs, automatically retries using READ_MEDIA_AUDIO permission
- Hardened SAF scan with per-directory and per-file error handling: scan now skips problematic files instead of aborting entirely
- Added visited directory tracking to prevent infinite loops from circular SAF references
- Fixed metadata enrichment cascading failure after one queued download fails: metadata APIs (Deezer, SongLink, Spotify) now use isolated `metadataTransport` so failed download connections cannot poison metadata requests
- Added immediate connection cleanup on every download failure path (error response and exception), not only periodic cleanup every N downloads
- Fixed incremental SAF scan edge case where `lastModified()` failure could misclassify existing files as removed (`removedUris`)
- Fixed tracks marked "In Library" still showing active download button - download button now shows as completed (checkmark) for local library tracks across all screens (album, playlist, artist, home/search)
- Fixed FFmpeg M4A-to-FLAC conversion erroneously triggered on already-existing FLAC files when re-downloading duplicates via Tidal
- Fixed SAF download creating empty artist/album folders when re-downloading duplicate tracks; directory is now only created after confirming the file does not already exist

## [3.5.1] - 2026-02-08

### Performance

- Removed PaletteService (palette_generator) from all screens for faster navigation and reduced memory usage
- Album, Playlist, Downloaded Album, Local Album, and Track Metadata screens now use blurred cover art as header background instead of dominant color extraction
- Removed `palette_generator` dependency
- App startup now renders immediately (`runApp`) while service initialization runs asynchronously in eager init
- Main shell provider subscriptions now use field-level `select(...)` to reduce unnecessary rebuilds
- Settings persistence now uses single-flight + queued save coalescing to avoid redundant disk writes
- Progress polling cadence adjusted to 800ms for download queue, local library scan progress, and Go log polling
- Android foreground download service progress updates are throttled (change-based updates + 5s heartbeat)
- SAF history repair is now batched (`20` items per batch) and capped per launch (`60`) to reduce startup I/O spikes
- Incremental library scan now builds final item list in-memory instead of reloading from database
- Local cover images in queue/library use direct `Image.file` with `errorBuilder` instead of `FutureBuilder` existence check
- CSV parser `_parseLine` rewritten: correct escaped-quote handling, no quote characters in output
- Removed unused legacy screen files (`home_screen.dart`, `queue_screen.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `settings_tab.dart`)
- Incremental local library scan now merges delta results in-memory and sorts once, avoiding full-state reload churn
- Queue local cover rendering now uses direct `Image.file` + `errorBuilder` (removed repeated async file-exists checks)

### Added

- Auto-cleanup orphaned downloads on history load (files that no longer exist are automatically removed from history)

### Changed

- Removed legacy screen files that were no longer used after the tab/part refactor:
  - `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/queue_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/settings_tab.dart`
- Concurrent download limit increased from `3` to `5` (settings clamp + Options UI chips now support `1..5`)
- Download queue now uses a single parallel scheduler path; `1` concurrency is handled as parallel-with-limit-1 (no separate sequential engine)
- Download queue now listens to settings updates in real-time so concurrency/output settings stay in sync while queue is active

### Fixed

- CSV parser now correctly handles escaped quotes (`""`) inside quoted fields during import
- Fixed dynamic concurrency update during active downloads: changing limit (e.g. `1 -> 3`) now schedules additional queued items without waiting current active item to finish
- Queue scheduler now re-checks capacity/queued items on short intervals to avoid blocking on long-running single active download
